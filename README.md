#Say What You Want

A simple web-chat app using [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
Say what you want, anonymous or not!

Check it out at: http://saywhatyouwant.herokuapp.com

##Features
- Chat is not censored nor persistent. Only those online can see it.
- You can scroll through your previous messages using the arrow keys (make sure your browser autocomplete is off).
- Glyphicon support exists! Messages like 'l', '<3', and '?' will print glyphicons! Have fun finding all the hidden ones :)
- Keeps track of number of users online.
- Your username can be set, or left blank (will default to 'Anon').
